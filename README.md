#MoonStore
This was my first attempt at rewriting [LivelyStore](https://github.com/mirkok/LivelyStore) in a high-level language.  
I decided to continue the work in JavaScript with [synclib](https://github.com/mirkok/synclib).
Nevertheless this little excercise taught me a lot about Lua.  
Lua is a great choice if you need to implement logic in a cross-platform way - [Lua's C interface](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#4) is awesome!  
Once I get the JavaScript implementation done I might actually port it back to Lua to get it working on mobile devices.
